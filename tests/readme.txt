Files in here are variations of the main-file:

llm_radio_theater_CPUonly_Example_HusbondAndWife

They are variations that seem to generate good entertaining talks/discussions/debates etc.

Copy them to the main-folder and rename them to something simple (For example, strip the description so only WIPxx.py remains. This makes them easy to run and modify further for your own needs)

The course of the talk depends greatly on even small changes to the prompts in these files, which is why I am uploading some I think work quite well.

Pay attention to the LLM model used in each file, as it is not necessarily the same in all files!
